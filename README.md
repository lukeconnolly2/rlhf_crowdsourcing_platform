# Project Setup Guide

This framework integrates with four external services to function optimally. Follow the steps below to configure each service and get your project up and running.

## External Services

1. **Clerk (Authentication)**

   - Used to enable user authentication via Google. Other providers (GitHub, Apple, etc.) may also be supported.

   [Clerk Documentation](https://clerk.com/)

2. **Azure Blob Storage (File Storage)**

   - Used for storing video files.

   [Azure Blob Storage Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/)

3. **Cloudflare Tunnel (Networking)**

   - Provides a secure connection between your server and the internet by forwarding traffic.

   [Cloudflare Tunnel Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)

4. **Resend (Email Notifications)**

   - Sends email notifications to users when new machine learning outputs are available.

   [Resend Documentation](https://resend.com/)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Cloudflare Tunnel

1. Sign up for a Cloudflare account and create a Cloudflare Tunnel.
2. Configure the tunnel to forward traffic from your domain to `localhost` on port 80 (where the tunnel will be running).
   - **Tip**: This process is easier if your domain is registered with Cloudflare.
3. Follow the Cloudflare guide to set this up:  
   [Cloudflare Tunnel Setup Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)

### Step 2: Configure Clerk for Authentication

1. Sign up for a Clerk account: [Clerk Sign-Up](https://clerk.com/)
2. Enable Google as the authentication provider (other providers are optional).
3. In Clerk, navigate to the development section and create a production instance.
4. Follow Clerkâ€™s documentation to obtain your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**.
   - These keys will be used for authentication in your app.

### Step 3: Set Up Azure Blob Storage

1. Sign up for an Azure account and create a Blob Storage bucket.
2. Create a container named `videos` for storing the video files.
3. Obtain the following from Azure:
   - **Connection String**
   - **Public URL** for the bucket (format: `https://[accountName].blob.core.windows.net/videos/`).

### Step 4: Configure Resend for Email Notifications

1. Sign up for a Resend account using the domain where the service will run.
2. Obtain an **API Key** from Resend for email functionality.

### Step 5: Fill In Configuration Files

1. **Secrets Configuration**  
   Open the `secrets.yaml` file and fill in the following values, ensuring they are **Base64 encoded**:

   - `DATALAKE_CONNECTION_STRING`: The connection string obtained from Azure.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Clerk's Publishable Key.
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Clerk's Secret Key.
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`: API Key from Resend.
   - Choose secure values for the MongoDB username, password, and private API key (also Base64 encoded).

2. **Public URL Configuration**  
   In `config.yaml`, set the `PUBLIC_DATALAKE_URL` to the Azure Blob Storage URL obtained earlier.

3. **Domain Configuration**  
   In `ingress.yaml`, replace the placeholder domain with the domain your service will run on:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     rules:
       - host: example.yourdomain.com
   ```

4. **Middleware Configuration**  
   In `middleware.yaml`, update the domain to match your service's domain:

   ```yaml
   accessControlAllowOriginList:
     - "https://example.yourdomain.com"
   ```

### Step 6: Install k3s and Apply Configurations

1. Install k3s on your server: [k3s Installation Guide](https://k3s.io/)
2. Apply the `yaml` files to the default namespace in your k3s cluster to deploy your service.
